# Pcbnew-related auxiliary functions that are useful for QA purposes
# (both unit tests ans utility programs)

# This is a massive hack in the CMake as I have no idea how to get this to
# link against pcbnew/pcbcommon/etc and still allow a dependency to also link
# THis should really be an add_library() and all the variables instead set using
# target_*() functions.
